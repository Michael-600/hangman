Hangman Game in Python

This is a Hangman game implemented in Python, featuring a graphical display powered by Python's turtle package. The game challenges players to guess words by selecting letters, with each incorrect guess revealing part of a hangman figure. With a dictionary of over 1,000 words, the gameplay remains engaging and varied.

Extensive Word List: Words are sourced from a text file containing over 1,000 entries, ensuring diverse and interesting challenges.
Fully Functional Game: Handles user input, tracks progress, and provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.

This feature will make the game accessible to players of varying skill levels and enhance replayability.
